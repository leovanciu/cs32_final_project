This project will perform a comprehensive comparison of computational complexity, execution time, and memory use in Python, R, and C/C++ for generic computational operations common in statistics and machine learning. This inclues generic loops, matrix and vector operations, common computationally heavy statistical algorithms like the bootstrap and Markov chain Monte Carlo (e.g., a simple Gibbs sampler), and some popular ML algorithms.
